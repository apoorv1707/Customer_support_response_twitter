# Customer_support_response_twitter
In this project, we analyzed the customer’s tweets to the companies and the company’s responses. 
We found a ‘customer support on twitter’ dataset which contained the text of the tweets of the customers as well as the response of the companies along with the response time. 
We tried to understand the pattern behind the tweets to get appropriate response time by applying machine learning classification and regression algorithms. 
We did sentiment analysis of all the tweets to quantify the text of the tweet to make it easier for interpretation, visualization, and modeling.
